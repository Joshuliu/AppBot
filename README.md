# AppBot + GitHub

AppBot's Github mainly provides information about the bot, but also some basic help. Get headstarted on using the bot here - not on [some fancy site](https://www.appbot.gq), but on some easy to read, plain black on white text. Here, you can get help all the help you need. If you want to suggest a feature or report a bug, or you want live support, you should still join [the support server](http://discord.gg/u5xGqzh). Otherwise, you can probably find what you need here.

## Ready to Start?
Well I'm not done with the documentation so you can't get help here rn.

## Support the Bot
There are a few easy ways to support the bot. To benifit the bot, you can either upvote the bot, or tell all your friends about it (click the widget below). If you'd want to support the bot by suggesting features or reporting bugs, you can join [the support server](http://discord.gg/u5xGqzh).
