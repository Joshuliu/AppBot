## The Docs for Lazy People
If you're way too lazy to read the docs, but you want to get an easier start to AppBot, then this is the perfect place for you! 

### Let's get Started!
Ready to start?
#### 1. Add the Bot
You probably already added the bot, but if you didn't, [add it now](https://bit.ly/appbot-invite) to get started.
#### 2. Create your first Application
The `/config` command is your go-to command if you want to configure applications and don't want to read anything. To get started, run this command to create your first application. If you already know how to do this command, you can skip this step.
#### 3. Inform your members
Inform your members that they can now apply with `/apply`, `/register` or `/report` depending on what kind of application you have created. You can also tell them to type `/help` for more commands.
